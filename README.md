[![Go](https://github.com/wanetty/upgopher/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wanetty/upgopher/actions/workflows/go.yml)

This is a simple Go web server that allows users to upload files and view a list of the uploaded files. The server can be run locally or deployed to a remote server.

This project tries to replace all file servers that use python, since there are always problems with libraries. Sometimes we want it to be on a remote pc and go gives you the possibility of cross-platform compilation and to work anywhere...

## Features
* Users can upload files by selecting a file and clicking the "Upload" button
* Uploaded files are stored in the "uploads" directory by default, but the directory can be changed using the -dir flag
* Users can view a list of the uploaded files by visiting the root URL
* Basic authentication is available to restrict access to the server. To use it, set the -user and -pass flags with the desired username and password.
* Traffic via HTTPS.
* Possibility to browse through folders and upload files...
